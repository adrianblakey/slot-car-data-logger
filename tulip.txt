o-> a straight - note: modern, long tracks have a slightly curved main straight  - code them as a straight not a curve
ou> left handed hairpin, think of the u starting in the top left and following the loop around
o)> left corner
o)/> banked left hander
o)//> steeply banked left hander
o))> moderately sharp left hander
o(((> sharp left hander
o(> right corner
o((> moderately sharp right corner
o(((> sharp right hander
on> right handed hairpin
o~)> esses - start left
o~(> esses - start right
o@)> loop around and over bridge start left
o@(> loop around and over bridge start right
o^> bump/bridge

then remove the o and > to get a short char representation. e.g. - is a straight, (( - moderate right etc.
